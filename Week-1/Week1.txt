WEEK 1 — Python Refresher & Data Handling

Overview:
This week focused on strengthening core Python skills and building a solid foundation in data handling using Pandas and NumPy. The goal was to become fully comfortable loading, inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and preparing engineering datasets for later analysis and machine learning.

Key Focus Areas:

1. Dataset Loading & Exploration
- Imported multiple engineering datasets (CSV).
- Reviewed dataset structure using head(), info(), describe().
- Checked for missing values, incorrect datatypes, outliers, and duplicates.

2. Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicates across datasets.
- Handled missing values via dropping or filling.
- Corrected datatype issues, especially timestamps and numerical columns.
- Cleaned invalid entries (e.g., negative sensor values, invalid timestamps).

3. Timestamp & Time-Series Preparation
- Converted string timestamps into proper datetime objects.
- Extracted time-based features: hour of day, day of week, month.
- Calculated engineering metrics such as charging duration, time intervals, power/energy indicators.

4. Basic Feature Engineering
Created meaningful new columns including:
- Charging duration (hours)
- Average charging power (kW)
- Daily energy totals
- Sensor deltas between readings
- Normalized values for comparison

5. Grouping & Aggregations
Used groupby() to identify patterns across:
- Vehicle types
- Charger types
- Days of the week
- Hours of the day
- Sensor categories
- Locations/stations

6. Working With Multiple Datasets
Applied all cleaning and feature engineering steps on:
- EV charging datasets
- Solar power generation logs
- Smart meter consumption data
- Motor temperature/vibration logs

7. Saving Cleaned Outputs
Exported cleaned and prepared datasets for Week 2:
- dataset_cleaned.csv
- dataset_v2_cleaned.csv
- dataset_solar_cleaned.csv

End-of-Week Outcome:
By the end of Week 1, I was able to:
- Efficiently load, inspect, and clean raw datasets
- Handle timestamps and derive useful time-based features
- Engineer numerical and categorical features for deeper analysis
- Prepare cleaned datasets ready for visualization and modeling in Week 2
