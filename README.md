## 🧠 Daily Habit
- ⏱️ **1–2 hours** of coding or reading daily  
- ⚙️ Use **engineering datasets** whenever possible  
- 📝 Document each day’s progress (notebook + short notes)  
- 📊 Summarize each week in `summary.md`  

> Example Daily Flow:
> 1. Pick a dataset or problem (e.g. motor temperature trends).  
> 2. Apply that week’s ML or analysis technique.  
> 3. Document findings with visuals or insights.
